 Learn to deploy any Node.js app to the web by practicing on an affordable DigitalOcean droplet!

In this course, you’ll learn how to deploy your Node.js applications to the web.

We’ll be using DigitalOcean, but these skills are transferrable to other services, such as Linode.

We’ll cover server (or droplet) setup and configuration, adding a domain name to our droplet, uploading our Node API to the server and getting the application running.

We’ll also set up Nginx as a proxy for our Node API and set up SSL/HTTPS.
